## ðŸ’» About the project
In this project, I created a Piano and it was inspired by Manual do Dev channel on Youtube! <br>
If you are a musician like me, this is a project that you can't miss out on! <br>
I am sure that, with the skills you learn by working on this project, you will be able to reach way more complex solutions for applications like this one! <br>
Something interesting about this piano is the possibility to choose between showing the keys or not by clicking on the switch button.

## ðŸ›  Technologies
This project was developed with the following technologies:
- <h3>Javascript</h3> âž¡ The JS part on this project was really interesting to me, because I got to learn even more about the use of arrow function, getAttributes and objects. 

- <h3>CSS</h3> âž¡ On the style of this project, I tried to keep as realistic as I could with the use of linear-gradient and also, using colors that I haven't used before. 

- <h3>HTML</h3> âž¡ On HTML, I learned more about using "data-" in an HTML Tag and how to sync it with Javascript.
